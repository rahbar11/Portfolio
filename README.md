# Create Your Portfolio
Create your own portfolio website by following simple steps:

## General Details
Open the 'App.js' file inside the 'src' folder and there you'll see an object named `portfolio`, there you should replace the information with your own.

## Projects
Open the 'Project Images' folder inside the 'src' folder and replace the images with your own projects' images.

Now open the 'App.js' file and find the `//Project Images` section. Now replace the path and name for your images.

Now inside the `portfolio` object, there's another object named `projects`, edit all the details inside it accordingly.

## Colors And Look
You can also change the website's look and make it totally yours. Simply find the `//Color Palette` section in the 'App.js' file and edit the colors according to yourself.

To edit hover color, transition duration, etc. you should edit the 'App.css' file which is also inside the 'src' folder.
